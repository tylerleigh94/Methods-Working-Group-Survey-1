Communication,,,,,,"STAT 471, COMM 522","Some messages on what methods are popular right now; for example experiments are very ""in"" while mediation analysis is not as likely to get published right now.",,"A required methods class should be broad enough that it is helpful to all students. The current one is far too narrow to accomplish that objective. Additionally, there is no methods class that covers something like ""how to develop a good question"".","Lack of classes in stuff I am interested in. There is no panel data class,  no text analysis class, etc.",
,,,,,,STAT 500,Seems like qualitative methods are not valuable on the job market. I have had trouble understanding what kinds of quantitative methods are most useful from political science classes.,,"I think the department should focus on teaching research methods, not statistics.","Classes on methods are not offered regularly, and there are very few of them.","The required course for first-years is very poorly conceived. Dorothy was a great instructor, but the course itself is not useful, and the way it is designed as a ""bonding"" experience is condescending and ridiculous. Faculty in the department need to decide what they feel students should know, and then they need to teach those classes."
,,,,,,,"The messages have been varied. In general many faculty claim that skill in quantitative methods is, if not synonymous with being a political scientist, necessary for success on the job market. Others hold that developing methodological expertise in one or a related set of methods, whether quantitative or qualitative, will serve students well on the market and in their professional careers. I think that the general trend in the department is toward the former opinion though the latter appears quite strongly held by a sizeable group of faculty. Moreover the job market results for Penn PhD students appear to indicate that good research leads to good job placement, whether it is quantitative or qualitative in method.","One of the best things about this course was simply the timeline and goal-setting aspect of it. Those who took it finished their prospectuses, on balance, earlier than those who did not, and that positions them well to finish in six years rather than longer. With limited funding opportunities that in itself is important. Writing drafts of the prospectus over the course of the semester/year also aided in development of theory and research design at an early stage. I particularly found useful reading other dissertations as understanding what a dissertation is is often difficult to imagine at the outset.","I envision the ideal methods course as an ideal methods sequence. Students should be required to take two methods courses, one corresponding to their primary field of study and one of their choice. Thus political theorists could take Problems and Concepts but would be free to take a course of their choosing inside or outside the department to satisfy the additional one: a statistics course for literacy purposes, the qualitative methods course for interviews, an anthropology, English, or history course - it would be open. Similarly for students in American politics, comparative politics, or international relations, they could take either the statistics or the qualitative methods course, and would likely be encouraged to take both, but could also further develop their own specializations by continuing either towards game theory or experimental methods on the one hand, or comparative historical methods, ethnography, or archival methods on the other, using in that regard courses outside the department's current offerings.","Timing of the courses and requirements within the program to engage in substantive coursework rather than methodological coursework. Due to leave and other issues of timing, the qualitative methods course was not offered until my third year, and I opted to audit it after completing required coursework.",

,,,,,,STAT 500-501,There is strong but often inexplicit messaging that quantitative research is necessary for publishing and getting a tenure-track job in the field.,,"I am interested in quantitative research and have struggled in Dorothy's class. This is less a reflection on her as a teacher and more on the course, which ultimately tests whether you've taken a previous stats or (better yet) econometrics course. Students who do well in this class are students who already know the information. If we really believe the content of this course is necessary, then there should be a course before it dedicated only to math. As such, I think for students who have no or very little math background, there should be available a full-semester of content like that in math camp that comes before a course like Dorothy's. This seems like it would lead nicely to the second year, two-semester sequence of the two higher-level PSCI stat courses. Further, these should not be required. If a student does not want to pursue quantitative research, that is her prerogative. What should be required, in my opinion, is a course that engages in an overview of methods current to the field along with epistemological foundations of social science research. I am shocked this is not available in the department (though maybe that is because I am new here!). This would improve methodological literacy, which I think is incredibly important.",Lacking a foundation of math and being expected to understand higher-level mathematical thinking without needed supports.,

Besides that an optional class on historical methods would be helpful to many students I think.",I have not sought methodological training.,"The current stats class is a waste of time for students who don't do quant methods. Rather than providing literacy in quant methods, it alienates students and unduly stresses students who are new to grad school thereby causing them unnecessary suffering. The first step should be to reform this course to provide a more useful introduction to quant methods. The math summer camp should be abolished; if a math camp is necessary for some students, it should be offered as a class during the first semester."

This constant pressure created and transmitted a sense of false goals, prioritizing what is fashionable in the industry today instead of giving students a sense of importance of a broader spectrum of methodological options and stressing out that different questions are best addressed by different methods. Instead primary quantitative methods faculty strove to reproduce themselves, the same cookie cutter approach and understanding of scientific inquiry as they learned it back in the early 2000s. All this set a rather dangerous, unfair and overall negative environment and power dynamics in each cohort. Instead of producing a ‚Äúsocializing‚Äù effect as it should, the required quantitative methods course divided each cohort in the past 3-4 years between those who does the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù methodology (adopted from the natural sciences without a second though about the different ontology of most phenomenon in social sciences from that of natural science, which is not only limited to statistical ‚Äúcasual inference‚Äù but any rigidly positivist highly generalizable kind of work, who now think of themselves as the only ‚Äúscientific‚Äù methods, with negative hierarchy implications relative to other kinds of methods) and those who do ‚Äúoutdated‚Äù anthropological- or historical-like work.",,The qualitative family of methods is represented by only one course while quantitative have a sequence.

I would argue, as an aside, that political theorists could use better methods training within their own subfield, but that's a separate issue.",,"I don't think a deep dive into any particular method should be required of all graduate students in the program. In my view, aside from a broad ""Intro to Poli Sci Research"" seminar that all students would take in their first year, there should be no universally-shared methods requirement. Rather, most methods training should be chosen by students based on their subfield and, more important, their research interests. If the department is committed to methodological breadth and diversity, which it should be, then any department-wide requirement to take a specific methods course is, in my view, indefensible. As a political theorist, I think our subfield would benefit from greater attention to methods, though that doesn't mean a new ""methods course"" is necessary.",,"At the risk of repeating myself, I wish the department was less insistent on making all graduate students take one kind of methods course, ignoring the obvious fact that not all political scientists need to learn advanced calculus to conduct their research (nor, for that matter, do all political scientists need the training in textual interpretation and the history of ideas that political theorists need). Unity in the department, and in the discipline, shouldn't come from methodological unity but rather from a common interest in exploring questions about politics that matter."
,,,,,,COMM 722: Theories and Methods in Qualitative Research,My committee has failed to intellectually engage with my methodological choices in my dissertation.,This course needs to decide what it is. Is it about learning the various paths to completion? The panels were great for that. Is it about keep students progressing? I guess the writing assignments accomplished that. Is it about improving prospectuses? Then peer review has to be the major component. It was overwhelming to try and do all three at the same time.,"Each student should get personalized advising from his/her advisor to develop the best methodological course sequence for them. The courses are out there, either at Penn or in the broader academic universe (i.e. ICPSR, IQMR). But there is no one size fits all, and letting students wander in the methods desert without direction is also not fruitful. Advisors need to do their job, and too often they simply do not.","I haven't faced challenges getting the training; I've faced challenges in a) getting advising on what sequence to take, and b) feeling like there was an intellectual community for methodologically pluralistic students. What if I want to take methods courses because they're interesting, not because I'm a quant or qual person? Where is there space for me?","The department needs fewer structures, not more, around methods training. Advisors are best positioned to help students navigate the methods coursework - if they are willing to do it, and frankly, not every faculty member is."

I think there needs to be a continuous emphasis on application, such as the projects used in Qual Methods that push students to use their own research interests to understand the methods. I wish there was a statistical methods class that incorporated this, or an overview quantitative methods course that mirrored the Qual Methods class and taught the basics of how to find relevant data or to design instruments/how to collect data for quantitative analysis, with a focus on tailoring assignments to our specific research interests.","I don't know which courses to take, especially since I am not clear how to best answer my question when I am still formulating my question. It's almost like a chicken-or-the-egg problem when we are trying to figure out what methods training we need to address our research agenda, but the research agenda keeps shifting.","I wish I had a better idea of which faculty are experts in which methods. This has been a ""learn as you go"" process but I think we'd all benefit if there is a way for students to know who does what and how in the department, and to feel comfortable approaching a variety of faculty for their methods input."

I have taken three courses outside of the department already (in history, english, Africana Studies; I am in my second year) because I wanted a more dynamic set of methods for theory/qual analysis","We need a more open conversation about the state of the field. If we want to give students the chance to tackle that field this is okay, but just because it is seemingly one way does not mean our department cannot give students the tools to tackle and challenge it. We also neglect cross-subfield engagement to some students' detriment. The message we send to theory and qual students is: you are not as important. This is absurd. I desperately want to understand quant so I can engage (and, in some senses critique) the effect and assumptions of other methods as a part of my overall project, but I don't feel I have the tools. Finally, there are several professors who have retired or are near retirement in this department that have clearly shaped our program for the better (Prof. Reed, e.g.) because of their challenges to methods and concepts in the field at large.

It would be better to target the training more, preparing an overview course for students not using quant methods in their own research and a much more detailed training for people willing to use them. For example, it would be great to have a causal inference course which really trains students in the cutting edge techniques of each method, spending several weeks on each of them and teaching students how to actually conduct a research using this method.","I couldn't find courses that were specific enough.
